OPPORTIA V2 - Admin Panel Architecture & Implementation Specification
Document Version: 2.0.0
Target Platform: OPPORTIA Platform V2 (Next.js 14 / Supabase / PostgreSQL)
Status: Implementation Blueprint

1. Executive Summary & Vision
The V2 Admin Panel is designed as a centralized operational console for super admins, system operators, and moderators. Built on a fresh V2 Next.js codebase while reusing the existing PostgreSQL production database, the Admin Panel features centralized RBAC, Supabase RLS integration, audit logging, real-time telemetry monitoring, and batch governance tools.

2. Security & RBAC Architecture
2.1 Roles & Hierarchy
SUPER_ADMIN
  └── ADMIN
       └── ORGANIZER (Host)
            └── USER
SUPER_ADMIN: Full platform control, role elevation/demotion, system kill-switch, database settings, global communications.
ADMIN: Platform moderation (Host KYC reviews, event moderation, support ticket resolution, opportunity management).
2.2 Granular Permissions Matrix
V2 transitions from legacy JSON strings to structured permission flags:

export enum AdminPermission {
  USERS_READ = "USERS_READ",
  USERS_WRITE = "USERS_WRITE",
  USERS_ROLES = "USERS_ROLES",
  HOSTS_AUDIT = "HOSTS_AUDIT",
  EVENTS_MODERATE = "EVENTS_MODERATE",
  COMMUNICATIONS_SEND = "COMMUNICATIONS_SEND",
  TICKETS_MANAGE = "TICKETS_MANAGE",
  INCIDENTS_MANAGE = "INCIDENTS_MANAGE",
  SETTINGS_WRITE = "SETTINGS_WRITE",
}
2.3 Server-Side Authorization Layer
All V2 admin routes enforce centralized policies:

// server/auth/authorization.ts
import { getCurrentUser } from "@/server/auth/authentication";

export async function requireAdminPermission(permission: AdminPermission) {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  if (!user) throw new UnauthorizedError();
  
  if (user.role === "SUPER_ADMIN") return user;
  
  if (user.role === "ADMIN" && user.permissions.includes(permission)) {
    return user;
  }
  
  throw new ForbiddenError("Insufficient permissions");
}

4. V2 Admin API Endpoints Layout
All V2 admin API endpoints reside in the server module:

src/app/api/v2/admin/
 ├── dashboard/stats/route.ts
 ├── users/route.ts
 ├── users/[id]/role/route.ts
 ├── users/[id]/lock/route.ts
 ├── applications/route.ts
 ├── applications/[id]/review/route.ts
 ├── events/route.ts
 ├── events/[id]/moderate/route.ts
 ├── communications/route.ts
 ├── communications/responses/[id]/route.ts
 ├── support/tickets/route.ts
 ├── incidents/kill-switch/route.ts
 └── settings/route.ts
5. PostgreSQL RLS Policies for Supabase Integration
When executing queries directly via Supabase / PostgreSQL RLS, policies check auth.jwt() -> app_metadata -> role:

-- RLS Policy for System Settings
CREATE POLICY "Only Super Admins can write system settings"
ON "SystemSetting"
FOR ALL
USING (auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' = 'SUPER_ADMIN');

-- RLS Policy for Host Applications Audit
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view and review host applications"
ON "HostApplication"
FOR ALL
USING (auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' IN ('ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN'));
